ðŸŽ¨ Carbon 1.3.1
===============

âž• Added (see project homepage @ GitHub (https://github.com/molnarmark/carbonSublime) for details):
  - show_status_messages to settings
  - use_emojis_in_status_messages to settings
  - If the selection is too big, the plugin now shows an error message in the status bar instead of
    trimming the selected text.

âž– Removed:
 - Code trimming
    Removed code trimming to fit Carbon's max character count as a means of improving user experience.
